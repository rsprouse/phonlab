    """Find a stop burst in a short interval of audio
    
This function takes an array of waveform samples and returns the location in time of the most prominent stop release burst in a segment of audio indicated by the `start` and `end` parameters.  Generally, `start` and `end` are taken from a TextGrid and define a short (50ms to 150ms) segment that has been labeled as containing a consonant of interest (a stop, fricative or nasal for example). In addition to the time of the strongest burst in the time-span, a burst strength score is also returned.

The algorithm looks at sudden peaks in the acoustic waveform that correspond to a large change 
in the mel frequency spectrum (a sudden increase in spectral energy) and scores each candidate with
a linear discriminant formula that was trained on TIMIT stop release bursts. The time and score of the winning candidate is 
returned.

Parameters
==========

x : ndarray
      a one-dimensional array of waveform samples
      
start :   float
      the time in seconds at the start of the waveform chunk in x

end :   float
      the time in seconds at the end of the waveform chunk in x

fs : number (default: 16000)
      the sampling frequency of the audio in x 

Returns
=======

    b_time :  float
        the time in seconds of the most prominent burst in x between start and end
        
    b_score : float
        a measure of the prominence of the burst

Example
=======
   
In this example we open a sound file with `get_signal()` and then search for the best candidate for a stop release burst in the interval from time 1.5 seconds to time 2.0 seconds.  The return value `b_time` is the location of the burst in seconds, and `b_score` is a measure of the burst prominence.  The `sgram()` plot in this example illustrates the use of `start` and `end` to produce a spectrogram of a specified portion of signal.

>>> x,fs = phon.get_signal("sf3_cln.wav",pre=1)
>>>
>>> t1 = 1.5
>>> t2 = 2
>>>
>>> b_time, b_score = phon.burst(x,t1,t2,fs)  # find a stop burst in the span from t1 to t2
>>>
>>> ax1,f,t,Sxx = phon.sgram(x,fs_in=fs,start=t1, end=t2)
>>> ax1.axvline(b_time,color="red")
