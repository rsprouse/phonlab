    Parameters
    ==========

    hz : scalar or array
        Frequency in Hz.

    Returns
    =======

def fricative(x,t,fs):
    """
    Measure fricative acoustic values, from a 20 ms window, centered on time `t`.

    In addition to reporting the spectral moments (COG, SD, skew, and kurtosis) of the multitaper
    spectrum (from `nitime.algorithms.multi_taper_psd()`), `fricative()` finds the "main peak" in the 
    fricative spectrum.  For fricatives with a resonant cavity, this is the lowest resonance of the cavity.  
    For those with no resonance the main peak frequency may be more a property of the source function.
     
    The main peak heuristic is to start by looking the in the spectrum above 500 Hz, for the lowest frequency peak that 
    is at least 80% of the amplitude range, separated from the nearest peak by at least 500Hz, and prominent
    by 6bB above the next nearest peak (see the **scipy.signal.find_peaks()** documentation).  If no peak is found, 
    relax the amplitude constraint, then the prominence constraint, and then both. 
    
    Parameters
    ==========

    x : ndarray
        a one-dimensional array of audio samples
    t : float
        the time (in seconds) at which to take measurements (this is usually in a fricative, but doesn't have to be).
    fs : int
        the sampling frequency of `x` (ideally should be at least 16000)

    Returns
    =======
     
    Fm : float
        Frequency of the first main spectral peak in Hertz
    FmB : float
        Frequency of the main peak on the Bark scale
    Am : float
        Amplitude (in dB) at Fm
    mode : string
        a report on the peak finding parameters used
    COG : float
        center of gravity, the first moment of the spectrum.
    SD : float
        standard deviation, the second moment of the spectrum.
    Skew : float
        scaled third moment, skew
    Kurtosis : float
        scaled fourth moment, kurtosis
    spec : ndarray
        the multi-taper power spectrum at the midpoint
    freq : ndarray
        the frequency scale of the spectrum

    Example
    =======

    This example returns fricative measurements from time 2.25 seconds in the 
    audio samples returned by `get_signal()`. The major peak and COG frequencies 
    are indicated in a plot of the spectrum.
    
    >>> x,fs = phon.get_signal("sf3_cln.wav")
    >>> Fm,FmB,Am,mode,COG,SD,Skew,Kurtosis,spec,freq = phon.fricative(x,2.25,fs)
    >>>
    >>> print(f"first major peak at {Fm:.1f}, Center of Gravity is {COG:.1f}")
    >>> plt.plot(freq,spec)
    >>> plt.axvline(Fm,color="red")
    >>> plt.axvline(COG,color="green")
