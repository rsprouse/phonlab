    """Convert a subtitles text file into a Praat TextGrid. 

Utilities like otter.ai can generate a transcription of the speech in an audio file.  A common format for this sort of transcription is .srt -- a "SubRip subtitle" file.  This function takes  an `srt` file as input and parses it, with the srt Python library, and writes it out with the audiolabel.df2tg() function.

Parameters
==========

filename : string
    the name/path to a subtitle file.

exclude_talkers : list
    A list of talkers who can be ignored, no textgrid will be produced for talkers on this list.  In the current implementation, there should be only one talker who will be kept - i.e. only one TextGrid will be written by this function.

quiet : boolean, default = True
    allow diagnostic messages to print

Returns
=======

    nothing is returned, the effect of the function is to write a file, the name of which is the input filename with .srt replaced by .TextGrid
