    The function uses the librosa.feature.rms to calculate an RMS contour from short time Fourier transforms taken from windows of 2048 samples with a step of 512 samples (the librosa.stft defaults).  This makes for different window lengths (in terms of seconds) depending on the sampling rate.  

    Parameters
    ==========
    y : ndarray
        a one-dimensional array of audio waveform samples

    Returns
    =======
    float
        the maximum rms value in y

    """Add noise to audio

    This function is partially adapted from matlab code written by Kamil Wojcicki, UTD, July 2011. It does the following:

    * pads the audio signal with 1/2 second of silence at the beginning and end
    * takes an audio file and mixes it with a noise (or a passed audio file) at a specified signal to noise ratio.
    * scales the peak intensity of the resulting mixed audio to prevent clipping
    * writes the resulting mixed audio as .wav files to an output directory


Parameters
==========
signal : Path or array
        the name of a .wav file, or an array of audio samples
        
noise_type : string
        The type of noise - one of "pink", "white", or "brown", or the name of a .wav file to be mixed with the signal_file.

fs_in : int, default = 22050
    If signal is an array, this is the sampling frequency of the audio in signal

fs : int, default = 22050
    The desired sampling frequency of the output signal

chan : int, default = 0 
    if the signal is stereo, select a channel for processing (0 = left, 1 = right)
    
snr : float, default = 0
        the signal to noise ratio in dB.  0 means that the signal peak RMS amplitude will be the same as the noise amplitude. Less than zero (e.g. -5) means that the signal amplitude will be lower than the noise, and greater than zero means that the signal amplitude will be greater than the noise amplitude.
        
target_amp : number, default = -2
        Scale the resulting signal (the result of adding the noise to the signal) so that the peak amplitude is target_amp relative to the maximum possible value.  Use a negative number to avoid clipping.  -2 means scale the resulting signal so that it is -2 dB below the maximum for digital audio files.

Returns
=======
    y : ndarray
        The result of adding noise to the signal
    fs : int
        The sampling rate of the signal in 'mixed'

Raises
======
    ValueError 
        if the noise_type is not a valid type


Example
=======
This example adds white noise at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3 dB

>>> x,fs = phon.add_noise("sf3_cln.wav","white",snr=3)
>>> phon.sgram(x,fs_in=fs)
